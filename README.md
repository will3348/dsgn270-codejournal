- I learnt -SVG today.
    - what is svg?
        - SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        - SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
        - SVG defines the graphics in XML format
        - Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated
        - SVG is a W3C recommendation
        - SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL
- We can style the svg with a style sheet.
- This is the logo I designed in figma. Then exporting it as a svg. Finally styled with style sheet.
