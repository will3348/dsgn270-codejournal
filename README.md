- I learnt -SVG today.
    - what is svg?
        - SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        - SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
        - SVG defines the graphics in XML format
        - Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated
        - SVG is a W3C recommendation
        - SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL
- We can style the svg with a style sheet.
- This is the logo I designed in figma. Then exporting it as a svg. Finally styled with style sheet.

- Today we talked about Figma Mockup design.
- I installed couple good plugins including stylelist, css export, figma tailwind.
- I created c0l0r scheme, typography, and my own components(buttons, cards).

- The reason doing that is preset some components. Then I can reuse them in future. fast and easy.

### Figmaâ€™s prototyping features allow you to create interactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs.

### why use prototype:

- Preview interactions and user flows
- Share and iterate on ideas
- Get feedback from collaborators
- Test interactions with users
- Present your designs to stakeholders
### How to do that
- Select the element you want to prototype.
- Open the Prototype tab in the right sidebar.
- Add interaction.
- Then set the details in that page.
- also, you can set the animation in Animation selector. 
- On top right, a play button beside SHARE, you can preview what you set.
